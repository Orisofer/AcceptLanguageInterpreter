## Accept Lang

This is a small project I've made to learn how to build a programming language.

The project is a small programming language named **"Accept"**.  
In this project, I've built:

- An Accept Tokenizer
- An Accept Parser
- An Accept Interpreter in C#

## ðŸ”¤ Source Code Example

```accept
say _Hello_Im_Accept_Lang%
mish x => 56%
im x > 42:
say _Good!%
o:
say _Shitty_Number%
say _the_program_is_working%
accept
```

## ðŸ§  Literals and Keywords

say â†’ prints something to the console

mish â†’ variable declaration keyword

im â†’ start of an if block

o: â†’ start of an else block

accept â†’ end of program

% â†’ end of line token


## ðŸ“š Language Grammar (BNF Style)

```
<Program> ::= <Statement>* "accept"
<Statement> ::= <SayStatement> | <VarDeclaration> | <IfElse>
<SayStatement> ::= "say" "_" <String> "%"
<VarDeclaration> ::= "mish" <Identifier> "=>" <Number> "%"
<IfElse> ::= "im" <Identifier> <Comparison> <Number> ":" <Statement>* "o:" <Statement>*
<Identifier> ::= <Character>+
<Character> ::= "a" | "b" | "c" | ... | "z"
<Number> ::= <Digit>+
<Digit> ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"

```
